_would really like to create tradition_

## Story

Didn't really like other missile toad models as many had significant overhangs underneath the body. I liked the toad model linked and use because the body was flush with the bottom surface, meaning no supports. I modeled the missile and hanger on to the toad, and here is the result!

Printed on my Ender 3 v1 using PLA, 10% gyroid infill, 0.2 mm layer heights, and scaled between 40-70%; note that 40% is a bit small, optimal size (for me) is around 50-70%.
